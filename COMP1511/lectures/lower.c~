// Demonstrating how to play with characters in C
// Program converts an upper case letter to a lower case letter

// Jaden Khuu z5416824

// Problem: A user inputs an upper case letter, and wants 
// the computer to output the same letter, but in lower case.
// Possibilities/Breakpoints?
// Eg. input is 'C' (67), and we want to output 'c' (99)
// Solution: - 'A' to find out the distance from the first of the alphabet and then we add that distance to little 'a'

#include <stdio.h>
