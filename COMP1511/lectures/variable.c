// This program shows how to declare
// and initialise a variable

// Jaden Khuu, 22T1 Week 1 Variables

// 1. Declare the variable - I am letting C know that I need a variable,
// I have to let it know what type of variable I also want
// 2. initialise the variable - give it some initial value

#include <stdio.h>
