For most if not all the images we have put alt text as a fallback incase the image fails to load. In general, the alt text is either the title of the listing (thumbnail) or text labelling it as an additional image

All text displayed is coloured to contrast the backdrop that it is on top of. Ie, white text on green background, black text on white background. Some text is also bolded to make it more legible

Inputs can be traversed using tab and shift-tab. Number inputs can be incremented using the up and down arrow keys.

Login and register forms can be completed by pressing enter.

Most if not all forms have a label of what input they are expecting. Labels also have the same name for the useState being modified in the form.
