                It's that time of year again where we harvest fruit and bring it to you in
                <br> boxes. We like fruit and we hope you do too..

            <div class="desc">A long time ago we didn't used to eat much fruit, but people kept getting
                <br> sick and realising you can't just eat meat and beans all the time. So viola,
                <br> fruit became popular. We're here to sell fruit, and I'm running out of things 
                <br> to say to sell you the fruit.</div>
