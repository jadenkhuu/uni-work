-- PART 1 --

-- In this part you will establish that any semigroup can be
-- "promoted" to a monoid simply by adjoining a new element,
-- and decreeing this new element to be the monoid identity.

-- The elements of `Promote s` consist of the following:
-- 1. all elements of s (in the form `Emb x`)
-- 2. a new element `New`, distinct from all elements of s.

data Promote s
  = Emb s
  | New
  deriving (Show, Eq)

instance (Arbitrary s) => Arbitrary (Promote s) where
  arbitrary =
    (\f x -> f x) <$> oneof [return (const New), return Emb]
                  <*> arbitrary

-- Task 1.1: Define a monoid operation `promoteOp` on
-- the type `Promote g` so that the adjoined element `New`
-- functions as the identity element of the resulting monoid.

promoteOp :: (Semigroup g) => Promote g -> Promote g -> Promote g
promoteOp (Emb x) (Emb y) = Emb (x <> y)
promoteOp New x = x
promoteOp x New = x
-- (retain the first case and define the other cases)

-- Task 1.2: Define the appropriate `Semigroup` and `Monoid`
-- instances for `Promote s`, using `promoteOp` as the monoid
-- operation.

instance (Semigroup s) => Semigroup (Promote s) where
  (<>) = promoteOp

instance (Semigroup s) => Monoid (Promote s) where
  mempty = New
  mappend = (<>)

-- Task 1.3: Write two predicates that QuickCheck can use
-- to test if a given monoid operation is lawful.
-- The first should test that the monoid operation is
-- associative, while the second should test that the identity
-- element satisfies the required laws.

testAssoc :: (Monoid g, Eq g) => g -> g -> g -> Bool
testAssoc x y z = (x <> y) <> z == x <> (y <> z)

testUnit :: (Monoid g, Eq g) => g -> Bool
testUnit x = (mempty <> x) == x && (x <> mempty) == x

-- HINT: once you complete 1.3., you'll be able to invoke e.g.
-- `quickCheck (testUnit :: Promote String -> Bool)`
-- to check your work on the instances above.



-- PART 2 --

-- In this part you will show that any ordered type gives rise
-- to a monoid where the monoid operation corresponds to
-- taking the minimum.

data MinMonoid t
  = EmbMM t
  | Infinity
  deriving (Show, Eq)

instance (Arbitrary t) => Arbitrary (MinMonoid t) where
  arbitrary =
    (\f -> \x -> f x) <$> oneof [pure (const Infinity), pure EmbMM]
                      <*> arbitrary

-- Task 2.1: Define a monoid operation `minMonoidOp` (`<>`)
-- in such a way that given any list [x1,x2,...,xn] of values,
-- evaluating `EmbMM x1 <> EmbMM x2 <> ... <> EmbMM xn`
-- results in `EmbMM xi`, where xi = minimum of [x1,x2,...,xn].

minMonoidOp :: (Ord t) => MinMonoid t -> MinMonoid t -> MinMonoid t
minMonoidOp (EmbMM x) (EmbMM y) = EmbMM (min x y)
minMonoidOp Infinity x = x
minMonoidOp x Infinity = x


-- Task 2.2: Define Semigroup and Monoid instaces for `MinMonoid`
-- using the `minMonoidOp` defined above.

instance (Ord t) => Semigroup (MinMonoid t) where
  (<>) = minMonoidOp

instance (Ord t) => Monoid (MinMonoid t) where
  mempty = Infinity
  mappend = (<>)

-- HINT: A correct implementation will pass the test below.

testIsMinimum :: [Int] -> Bool
testIsMinimum xs
  | null xs = mconcat (map EmbMM xs) == Infinity
  | otherwise = mconcat (map EmbMM xs) == EmbMM (minimum xs)



-- PART 3 --

-- A SparseList is an alternative representation of lists, designed to
-- require less memory for lists where adjacent elements are mostly
-- equal.

newtype SparseList a = SparseList [(Int,a)] deriving (Show,Eq)

-- To each element we attach a positive number, representing its
-- multiplicity. Thus, the list
--    ['a','a','a','b','b','a','a']    aka   "aaabbaa"
-- Is represented as follows in a SparseList:
--    [(3,'a'),(2,'b'),(2,'a')]
-- The price we pay for this is that the element type must be
-- an instance of Eq.

instance (Arbitrary a, Eq a) => Arbitrary (SparseList a) where
  arbitrary = fromList <$> arbitrary

-- The `SparseList` constructor is not supposed to be invoked directly
-- by users. Instead, we use the "smart constructor" `fromList`
-- defined below. This smart constructor ensures that lists of type
-- `SparseList a` are well-formed.

fromList :: Eq a => [a] -> SparseList a
fromList [] = SparseList []
fromList (x:xs) =
  SparseList $ (n+1,x):result where
  SparseList result = fromList rest
  n = length $ takeWhile (==x) xs
  rest = drop n xs

-- Task 3.1: Define, as a predicate specifying what it means for a
-- sparse list to be well-formed. In a well-formed sparse list, all
-- multiplicities need to be positive, and the list must be maximally
-- packed (so that adjacent elements must be distinct).
isSparseList :: (Eq a) => [(Int,a)] -> Bool
isSparseList xs = error "'isSparseList' not defined"

-- Task 3.2: Define the append operation on SparseLists.  Feel free to
-- use the template below.  Hint: the last element of xs in the final
-- clause needs to be treated specially.
append :: Eq a => SparseList a -> SparseList a -> SparseList a
append (SparseList []) sl = error "append not defined"
append sl (SparseList []) = error "append not defined"
append (SparseList xs) (SparseList ((m,y):ys)) = error "append not defined"

-- Task 3.3: Write a predicate that tests whether the `append`
-- operation preserves the `isSparseList` invariant defined above,
-- i.e. that appending two sparse lists yields a well-formed
-- sparse list.

testSparseList :: SparseList Int -> SparseList Int -> Bool
testSparseList = error "'testSparseList' not defined"

-- Task 3.4: Define a semigroup and monoid instance for `SparseList a`
-- with monoid operation `append`. Write tests for the monoid laws.

instance (Eq t) => Semigroup (SparseList t) where
  (<>) = error "'<>' for 'SparseList t' not defined"

instance (Eq t) => Monoid (SparseList t) where
  mempty = error "'mempty' for 'SparseList t' not defined"
  mappend = error "'mappend' for 'SparseList t' not defined"
