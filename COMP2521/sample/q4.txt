Question 4

Which of the given algorithms could have been used to construct the
mininum spanning tree? Justify your answer.

Kruskals algorithms

Out of all the algorithms, only kruskals and prims can be used to find
a minimum spanning tree. The difference between kruskals and prims
is that prims algorithm requires each new added edge to be added onto
the existing added edges.

Seen in the first 2 steps, A-E and C-D, the new edge C-D is added but
not connected to the existing edges
