NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of cells in the maze.

============
  solveBfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: The worse case scenario for solveBfs is having to visit every
possible cell in a maze. Since there are 'n' number of cells and we can never 
visit a cell twice, the worst case is O(n)

============
  solveDfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: The worse case scenario for solveDfs is having to visit every
possible cell in a maze. Since there are 'n' number of cells and we can never 
visit a cell twice, the worst case is O(n)
