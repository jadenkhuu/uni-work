COMP 2521 Sort Detective Lab Report
by Jimmy Duong (z5418904), Jaden Khuu (z5416824)

In this lab, the aim was to measure the performance
of two sorting programs, without access to the code,
and determine which sorting algorithmn each program uses.

Experimental Design

The design for this experiment will be based on how the sorting algorithmns
have different goals in such that there are different time complexities, 
stabilities and adaptabilities. Through finding the worst
case time complexity to be either O(n^2) or O(nlogn) we are able to almost 
immediately deduce whether the sorting algorithmn is either belongs to 
the (Bubble, Insertion or Selection) category of sorts or the (Merge and quick
sorts).
